# Hi, I´m Virginia 😄 I´m a Front-End Developer and UX/UI Designer.

#### Since I started working as a UX / UI designer, the development piqued my interest. Following that curiosity, I did a bootcamp as Full-Stack Developer and I loved it.

#### My years as a freelancer helped me to be decisive in my projects, not to be afraid of new challenges and to be self-demanding.

#### In my current position, I am improving my skills in Front-end development meanwhile my previous experience in UX/UI gives me a special sensibility to details.
##### ⚡ HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, TypeScript, BabelJS, DOM, WebPack, React, Angular, Flux, Context API, SQL, MySQL, Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, git, GitHub.
##### ✏️ Figma, Sketch, Zeplin, Adobe XD, Adobe Creative Suit.
