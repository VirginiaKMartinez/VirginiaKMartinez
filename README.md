# Hi, I¬¥m Virginia üòÑ I¬¥m a Front-End Developer and UX/UI Designer.

#### Since I started working as a UX / UI designer, the development piqued my interest. Following that curiosity, I did a bootcamp as Full-Stack Developer and I loved it.

#### My experience in web development and design gives me the skills to create unique, high-quality websites that are both visually stunning and highly functional.

#### My experience in both development and design makes me a valuable asset to any team.
