# Hi, IÂ´m Virginia ðŸ˜„ IÂ´m a Front-End Developer and UX/UI Designer.

###### Since I started working as a UX / UI designer, the development piqued my interest. Following that curiosity, I did a bootcamp as Full-Stack Developer and I loved it.

###### My years as a freelancer helped me to be decisive in my projects, not to be afraid of new challenges and to be self-demanding.

###### In my current position, I am improving my skills in Front-end development meanwhile my previous experience in UX/UI gives me a special sensibility to details.
###### HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, BabelJS, DOM, WebPack, React, Angular, Flux, Context API, SQL, MySQL, Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, git, GitHub.
